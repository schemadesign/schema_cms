Feature: CMS-26-Editor

  As an Editor
  I want to be able to preview the uploaded data
  so that I can confirm it is what I wanted to be uploaded

  Background: User uploaded a valid CSV file
    Given I am on Login page
    And  I have logged in as an admin with valid login and valid password
    And I have entered project details page
    And I have entered sources tab

  Scenario: User can see newly created data source
    When I choose to upload a valid CSV file
    Then I am on Data Sources page
    And I can see status of file updating on the tile
    And newly created data source is displayed on list

  Scenario: Preview page matches design
    Given I chose to upload a valid CSV file
    And I am on Data Sources page
    And I can see status of file updating on the tile
    And newly created data source is displayed on list
    When I choose to see data source preview
    Then I am on data source preview page
    And data in preview table matches data from CSV file

  Scenario: Field Preview page matches design
    Given I chose to upload a valid CSV file
    And I am on Data Sources page
    And I can see status of file updating on the tile
    And newly created data source is displayed on list
    And I chose to see data source preview
    And I am on data source preview page
    And data in preview table matches data from CSV file
    When I choose to see field info preview
